The executable for the Chromium process is currently x64 only but runs successfully on M1 Macs via Rosetta.</p><p>• The Windows and macOS plugins embed Chromium Embedded Framework, so you must display a copy of its included BSD-style license in your desktop app’s about page or credits.</p>]]></content>
