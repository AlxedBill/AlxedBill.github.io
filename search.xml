It becomes a real hassle moving images in and out of folders before and after processing or deleting processed duplicate images that you didn’t want to process.

This is a must-have asset if you are working with Terrains on mobile devices.</p><p> It does what it says. It also automates everything for you so you don’t have to do anything in your scene after the conversion. I want to also include, a lot of people don’t really understand how unity terrain works so after the conversion they complain about blurry textures, etc.</p><p> Unity blends the textures creates lods, chunks, and does tricks to generate the terrain, converting it to mesh it eventually looks different or worse than the default since a mesh contains a material with a texture &amp; normal map and the mesh itself. If you don’t understand what”Terrain to mesh” actually does do not buy it, and expecting something entirely different. This plugin supports exporting the terrain to smaller chunks it also exports the texture to chunks in case you want to load each chunk separately or create occlusion. It’s great.</p>]]></content>

The executable for the Chromium process is currently x64 only but runs successfully on M1 Macs via Rosetta.</p><p>• The Windows and macOS plugins embed Chromium Embedded Framework, so you must display a copy of its included BSD-style license in your desktop app’s about page or credits.</p>]]></content>
