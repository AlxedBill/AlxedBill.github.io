TEXDraw render expressions using mesh and dynamic fonts, so it can be changed dynamically in gameplay. It uses LaTeX as the standard syntax to define symbols or specific styles.</p><p>This asset contains 16 fonts + one packed sprite, all cumulates into +900 math symbols ready to be used in any kind of project, ranging from greek letters until geometrical symbols. These fonts and symbol packs are lightweight, yet optional, and can be removed later in the build if necessary.</p><p>TEXDraw can be displayed in Unity UI rendering or 3D mesh by simply attaching TEXDraw component in scene. It also has built-in integrations with TextMeshPro SDF Rendering. Besides that, the asset source is fully open without embedding any compiled libraries into your project.</p><p>TEXDraw syntax is rich of features. With custom LaTeX interpreter, it can draw various math scripts, integrals, roots, fraction, matrix, table, etc., plus many glyph features including custom fonts, size, color, styles, alignments, word wrap, kerning, paragraph spacing, line spacing, lean indent, body margin, and much more.</p><p>Loop<br>TEXDraw is not just about displaying LaTeX. There’s also additional components like TEXLink for clickable sections of text and TEXInput for WYSIWYG runtime editor. Current TEXDraw version aims to be mostly-compatible with other TeX softwares like MathJax or TexStudio so if you have use them before, you can get familiar with TEXDraw syntax very quickly.</p><p>TEXDraw is mobile-friendly. It does not require any custom shaders. It also does nothing when nothing is changed. In performance side; it is light and has its own pooling system to generate (nearly) zero GC allocation each time the text regenerate. TEXDraw has its own performance benchmark scene, and shows that it is only up to 40% slower than standard UI Text.</p><p>Besides it great functionality in the game, it also offers a fully customized and functional editor, from project-wide preference, editor highlights, font manager, material managements, benchmark tool, menu items, and many one. One of the best part of using this asset is how it imports a new font, by just inserting any font or sprite, then let the package do the rest of importing process.</p><p>More features are described in documentations that linked above. If you’re encountering problems, have a look to common troubleshooting section in manual. Bugs and feature requests can be informed and requested using forum or email. If you have purchased this asset you can request for Git Access to get bleeding (in development) version of this asset.</p>]]></content>

It can give you a little visual pop to your project and is simple to set up. I got this on sale, so my review is based on around a $15 price point. At that price I bought it on a whim; at the base price, around $30, I’d say it’d be worth it if you really needed some ground effects if only for the simplicity of integration this package offers.</p>]]></content>

All your data of this hierarchy extension will be placed not in the scene, but rather in a separate folder</p><p>WHAT’S NEW:</p><p>TopBar and Quick layouts button at the topbar. Now, you can add quick layout buttons at topbar, like a web browser tabs.<br>Each module now works separately, so you can completely disable any part of the assest according to your needs.<br>The new caching system and gl batching improves workflow and initialization<br>▬</p><p>Highlights:<br>• Modules:The ability to use tags, layers, sprite, prefabs, descriptions, sorting order, locking buttons, audio, or to create custom extension</p><p>• Search: A special modal window allows you to search for objects in many ways and manipulate them</p><p>• Memory: The special Memory module allows you to display the size of three-dimensional models or size of textures as well as the ability to use broadcast calculation for objects with same textures or models</p><p>• A special context menu: For using commands such as grouping or change hierarchy siblingings order</p><p>• Components icons: Allows you to filter selection, invoke methods, or manipulate with variables directly through the interface</p><p>• Other: And many many other small things, escape to close a prefab mode for example, hide modules using function keys, or storing the settings in special files in the “library” folder or in a scriptableobjects in the “assets” folder to share it with your colleagues</p><p>Review<br>It has so many features that I couldn’t live without, it really should be the standard hierarchy built into Unity!</p><p>The new asset update has removed hypergraph and hierarchy bottom bar with favorites and recent gameobjects. It’s alright to add new features to a more expensive version of the asset but actually removing existing features from the current asset in this “update” is not cool.

A great balance between low-poly and realistic detail that fits the aesthetic I wanted for my game perfectly.<br>This pack has really treated me well so far. Important parts that one would want to animate are separate from the base model, such as the pistol slide being detached from the base for easy firing animation. Someone else commented that it’s complicated to change the color on these, and that has been fixed, so it’s just a simple click or few lines of code to get it to do what you want. Great pick up and well worth it.<br>These models are great, but the gun and ammo clip are all one game object.</p><p>Good luck separating them if you don’t know blender.</p><p>Edit: Reached out the the developer and he fixed it immediately. Very Impressed</p><p>I needed some low-poly, fairly stylized, slightly sci-fi weapons that I could use for an FPS and these were exactly what I was looking for. Great work and thank you!</p>]]></content>

Save time and build them directly from Windows.</p><p>This one-stop build tool takes as input:<br>– an Xcode project directory created by Unity<br>– (optionally) a digital signing identity<br>…and creates an IPA package of your iOS app and immediately serves it for OTA (over the air) deployment, AND a .deb package of your iOS app ready to be deployed with Cydia. Upload your fresh app instantly to any iOS device connected to your network!</p><p>Debug made simple<br>The Remote Debug Console receives all your application logs and displays them live on your computer’s screen, while your app is running on your device. Even stack dumps are transferred when it crashes !<br>No jailbreak needed!<br>Simply reuse your digital signing identity from Apple’s iOS Developer Program (or create a new one).

Thoughtful, well documented and it works! Thank you for taking the time to develop this, it is obvious that you’ve methodically gone through the pain points to make our lives easier.</p><p>I wish I knew about that asset earlier. It works like a charm, it’s very well documented and easy to use. I had a couple of issues and the publisher answered my emails very rapidly, quickly helping me to find a solution. It’s even possible to build and upload by command line, which is a great addition to my Editor scripts toolset. It is going to save me so much time! Just buy it! One thing to note though: you will need access to a Mac at least once to generate mandatory certificate files.</p>]]></content>

TC2 makes use of the latest GPU technology to give you instant real-time results, which makes creating terrains faster and more easy than ever before. TC2 its folder like layer system and workflow is similar to that of Photoshop, which makes it possible to have full control and make quick changes any time during the workflow.</p><p>Not only great care is taken about simplicity, clean interface, usability etc. But TC2 has an enormous increase in power, freedom, scale ability, diversity and performance. TC2 is truly a ‘Next Generation’ terrain tool that can generate on the GPU, making it able to create and update terrains with frames per second that makes it even possible to animate terrains. This opens the doors for instant real-time streaming.</p><p>Second TC2 is an unlimited blending powerhouse. With TC2 you can create an immersive amount of diversity. As in TC2 everything is group able and groups can be grouped and those can be grouped, etc. Every group is mask able and transformable. And any group or node you can drag and drop it in your project to save as a prefab and drag and drop it back anywhere in TC node window. So any adjustments can be made anytime during the workflow on any group level without any waiting time.</p><p>We’ve all seen nice terrains with uniform texturing and placement, which is of course possible to make with TC2, but what makes a terrain stand out is its diversity. To not bore your audience you need dynamic terrain and with TC2 you can create unlimited biomes on small- and very large scales, anything is possible.</p><p>Features:</p><ul><li>Includes many examples and presets.</li><li>Multi terrain-tile support out of the box, TC2 treats it as one terrain.</li><li>Linear graphical node based GUI interface. Specially designed for user friendliness, cleanliness, overview and scale ability. For beginners its a easy to learn and for experts and artists a breeze to work with.</li><li>Folder like layer system which is similar to Photoshop its layer system.</li><li>Advanced masking, use an unlimited amount of masks on a layer and layer group.</li><li>Makes use of the latest GPU technology to give real-time results. No need for visualizers, guessing and waiting what might happen.</li><li>No hassle with aligning of nodes and no crossing node connection wires all over your screen. Just drag and drop your node where you want it and it will snap in place.</li><li>One powerful workflow to create a complete terrain with height-maps, splat texturing, color-maps, placing vegetation and objects.</li><li>Advanced presets. Uses Unity’s drag and drop prefab system to save&#x2F;load presets which can be a node, a layer or an entire layer group.</li><li>Biomes, unlimited freedom with the amount of nodes, groups and levels. Each group&#x2F;level can be masked, transformed, cloned and saved&#x2F;loaded with drag and drop. Which makes it possible to create terrains within your terrain.</li><li>Terrains are fully scale-able and expandable. TC2 generates in world space. So no matter how you position the terrains or how many terrain tiles, it will always generate at the same position. So you can expand&#x2F;shrink your world anytime during the workflow without the need of re-positioning or re-scaling of nodes.</li><li>Export height-maps, splat-maps, color-maps and normal maps.</li><li>Automatic terrain adapting based on manually placed objects. The way the terrain and spawned objects adapt is all based on how you setup the nodes with rules in TC2.</li><li>Included complete noise library including erosion looking noises: Perlin, Billow, Multi-fractal, Cell noise, IQ, Swiss, Jordan and Random with each many variations.</li><li>Many node rules like height, angle, splatmap, collision, convexity, noises, mathematical shapes, images and 16 bit raw images.</li></ul><p>aaaaaa</p><ul><li>Mathematical shapes: Circle, gradient, rectangle and constant.</li><li>Can be used in runtime and generates ultra fast, needs DirectX11 or Metal.</li><li>Included source code with clean C# code. Each node type and node groups have its own GameObject with attached script and can be easily modified in run-time.</li><li>Advanced and easy to use stamp node, and includes high resolution stamps.</li><li>Image node for using images for input and masks.</li><li>Mesh collision detect system that is independent of physics colliders and is pixel accurate.</li><li>Global seed and a seed on many levels for the procedural noises to create randomized terrain.</li><li>RTPv3 integration with auto color-map and normal-map assigning.</li><li>Node window uses culling and can contain a huge amount of nodes. What is not on the screen is not drawn.</li></ul>]]></content>

It can be used on any type of game for any platform.</p><p>We use MCS cell based combining in our game D.R.O.N.E. for the modular building in our arena editor and pre-made arenas, without MCS our game wouldn’t run…</p><p>Instead of manually combining meshes, which is very tedious, MCS will do this automatically for you and the performance improvements it gives cannot be achieved with manual combining. Just simple drag and drop a MCS prefab in your Scene and tweak the many available conditions to your specific needs and you are ready to go.</p><p>MCS can give up to 20x better performance compared to Unity’s static batching. MCS can give a more smooth and stable FPS. The smaller the to combining meshes are the more performance improvement it gives. It works great on systems that use modular meshes as well as static objects like buildings, props, rocks, etc. MCS has a unique features to remove geometry that is never visible to the camera. This can save a lot of lightmap texture space, memory and increases even more the performance.</p><p>Not only are the draw calls greatly reduced, but since MCS combines meshes into cells, it dramatically improves culling performance as well. Less objects need to be culled, z-sorted and LOD switched. MCS has automatic LOD compatibility. LODs are switched per cell which gives better performance and less LOD popping.</p><p>With its extension MCS Caves &amp; Overhangs, MCS removes inside geometry for stacked meshes that form any formations like rocks to build caves and overhangs. We also use this feature of MCS in D.R.O.N.E. to optimize the rocks and rock caves and overhangs in our pre-made arenas, where it reduces our rock triangles with 60-75%, which gives an unbeatable performance and memory saving on lightmap textures.</p><p>MCS Dungeon Architect Demo<br>MCS Modual City Allay Pack Demo</p><p>Documention | Forum</p><p>Features:<br>– Supports &gt;Unity 5.1, 2017.x, 2018.x, 2019.x and 2020.x .<br>– Supports all platforms (PC, Mac, Linux, Android, IOS, WebGL, etc).<br>– Supports Standard Rendering, URP and HDRP.<br>– Supports all mesh formats that Unity supports (.fbx, .obj, .dea, 3ds, .skp, etc).<br>– Easy to use, simple and self explaining Inspector with tool-tips.<br>– Reduces Draw Calls<br>– Advanced and performant multi-threaded combine job manager with lowest memory overhead possible and GC friendly.<br>– Supports cell based mesh combining, which is optimal for culling, z-sorting and LOD switching.<br>– Can be used as a faster alternative to Unity’s static batching and can give significant to drastic performance improvements.<br>– Fully automated combining like Unity’s static batching (but with more options), no tedious manually combining and get results in a few clicks.<br>– Extensive lightmapping support for realtime and baked GI.<br>– Save lightmap texture space and memory by removing geometry.<br>– Automatic LOD compatibility. LODs are switched per cell which give better performance and less LOD popping.<br>– No vertex or triangle increase compared to original meshes.<br>– Remove geometry that is under any surface (terrain and&#x2F;or meshes). E.g. for rocks this can reduce +35% of the geometry.<br>– Remove overlapping geometry with its extension MCS Caves and Overhangs, which can reduce 60-75% of the geometry together with below terrain removal.<br>– Remove backface culling geometry on the background geometry (which the camera can never see). This can reduce +50% of the geometry by itself and +80% with the inside and below terrain removal.<br>– Original GameObjects components keep working, e.g. scripts, colliders, etc.<br>– Automatically switches between rendering combined or original GameObjects and can be easily reverted.<br>– Combine in Editor and&#x2F;or Runtime.<br>– Combine dynamic meshes (Multiple meshes for one moving part can be combined into one mesh).<br>– Supports negative scaling and double shadows.<br>– Runtime console to test and find the fastest combining settings (a build is the way to test true performance gains, which are higher than in Unity Editor).<br>– Multiple MCS prefabs can be used for different settings, e.g. different cell sizes, removal of geometry, etc.<br>– Extensive search conditions which GameObjects with meshes to include. The right filtering can increase the performance boost and save memory.<br>– Source code included.<br>– Runtime API.</p>]]></content>

Grabbit is compatible with any Unity version starting from 2019.3.</p><p>⭐We cannot imagine Level Designing in Unity without Grabbit, and we are confident you’ll be convinced too!⭐</p><p>Review<br>Just started to use this for a new project im doing, at first this asset may not look a game changer but when you start to “dress the scene” with small assets you will feel the real value of this plugin. Grabbit makes very easy to place things like debris, falled bottles, rocks, books, etc in a natural way. It you feel like you waste many hours placing the small things this may be a good asset to have in mind</p><p>This is a really cool tool. Works wonders. Works how it states, however, Ive run into a large number of bugs with it. Some of which destroy the current scene im working on by affecting the wrong objects. eg: 1. object children floating away 2. the wrong objects randomly fall through other objects 3. ignore tag&#x2F;layer not working sometimes 4. perma-break on run-time physics after using tool in editor The publisher is very responsive, I just feel bad dishing out constant bugs to him for my specific scenarios. The tool still has great use. Ive decided I will use this tool in a separate unity instance and transfer my objects as a package to the desired instance. This might sound like a weird alternative but it helps with object placement and is a very cool tool, when its only affecting the objects you want. The tool is worth the money. Makes things look natural.</p>]]></content>

Or just export plain polygon meshes.<br>– you can sculpt and then animate assets directly in Unity without the need for complex mesh operations<br>– everything stays interactive, what you do in the editor works in game just as well<br>– fast level design iterations, clayxels can help you achieve complex architectural shapes in a matter of seconds<br>– export to FBX to move your clayxels models to any external package if you need so</p><p>Clayxels works with plain, simple points.<br>– the point cloud that clayxels generates is shaded per vertex, rendering it is as cheap as a standard mesh<br>– nothing stops you from interactively creating volumes during gameplay. Only at that point a compute-shader will update the point cloud (this is of course a GPU heavy operation that will impact on your FPS)<br>– clayxels can be animated in editor or used with procedural motion at runtime<br>– physics work with standard colliders, you can even use clayxels to generate its own mesh colliders</p><p>Open C# code, editable render shaders and signed-distance functions, but you can ignore all of that if you like. Clayxels works by simply moving around standard Unity GameObjects.<br>– Extend or hack the provided APIs or simply move Unity’s standard GameObjects to interact with the volumes<br>– Write new shaders via code or use Amplify Shader to customize the existing shaders with nodes<br>– All the mathematical functions are exposed and you can add your own to change how the signed distance field is generated</p><p>Current limitations (subject to change as development progresses):<br>– performance will vary a lot depending on the available GPU, this is especially relevant if you plan on using clayxels at runtime in your game<br>– it is preferable to use clayxels on machines with a dedicated GPU to get optimal performance<br>– mobile targets are untested and will work using the included baking functionality only<br>– webgl is not a supported target</p><p>Review<br>I LOVE voxel modeling, including this SDF implementation of it. It’s really cool to be able to do this in Unity! When compared to MudBun, I find this to be easier to use, has better shaders, and a better community. But each have their own advantages. Highly recommended.</p><p>What I like about it:<br>– It’s fun and easy to use, really lets you enjoy the process and explore your creativity.</p><p>What I don’t like:<br>– Getting tons of import issues and errors on import and build.<br>– Models look great, but are very high poly making using this for mobile games less suitable. </p><p>Overall 8&#x2F;10.</p>]]></content>

It is both designer and programmer-friendly allowing for quick prototyping and implementing of unique behaviors. Focused on flexibility, ease of use and performance, it is suitable for both small, medium and large-scale projects.</p><p>With efficient code and caching algorithms, the tool provides excellent performance even when lots of objects are constantly updated. Dreamteck Splines provides scalable solutions for different use cases. For example, games using stationary splines can benefit from baking geometry and optimized sample modes while titles requiring dynamic updates to the splines can use multithreading to free up the main thread.</p><p>Key features:<br>– Editor and Runtime spline creation<br>– Hermite, Bezier, B-Spline and Linear splines<br>– Path following with constant speed<br>– Mesh generation<br>– Junctions<br>– Object and particle control<br>– Spline projection<br>– Mobile friendly<br>– Primitives and presets<br>– Import &amp; Export functionality<br>– Morph states<br>– Multithreading<br>– Easily expandable functionality<br>– Extensive User manual with examples<br>– Open source!</p><p>Review<br>This is a really powerful and well thought out plugin! And if you have a problem regarding the use of the plugin, the support is always pretty helpful 🙂</p><p>I was looking for a spline solution for creating roads.<br>I found this asset and found a lot of modular usage in the asset for building the roads.<br>I was trying to implement a lightweight collision solution for the road without using mesh collider, the developer helped me providing a custom script for implementing the collision with Spline which worked great.</p><p>It worked fine before but now when I hover over the spline follower inspector I’m getting an error somewhere here in the SplineFollowerEditor script</p><p>if you are working with builtin render pipeline, this asset is for you, if you aren’t try another asset.</p><p>splines has a bug were in URP the spline is facing the scene view always (as in the editor scene view camera), the spline acts like a billboard, but it clips away from the gameview.</p><p>this happens, even in builds.. in a weird way… its a weird bug, cant get around it, sad very good asset just the lack for support for urp kills it for me. </p><p>and even tho there’s a discord server, apparently email is the only way to really get support.</p><p>;got help with email very fast, a fix is in the works got mailed a temp fix involving having a camera with main tag in the scene while an official fix is in the works!</p>]]></content>

My assets are also a bit more complex what the example shows and also needed colliders for the whole hierarchy but only on the top level.

There are two ways</p><p>Whether it yields good results depends on the mesh, it has plenty of configuration options so you’ll have to play around a bit. In the future Unity plans to implement V-HACD themselves so it may become obsolete at some point, but so far it’s the only option to get automatic convex decomposition in Unity unless you want to compile the C++   V-HACD library yourself and write a C# wrapper.

CA uses the GPU Instancer core and adds GPU skinning techniques on top of GPUI’s indirect instancing solution and GPU culling techniques. This results in a combination which will allow you to get the most out of GPU Instancing in Unity for your animated characters.</p><p>———————————<br>FEATURES<br>———————————<br>– Indirect GPU instancing with skinned meshes.<br>– GPU frustum, occlusion and distance culling.<br>– VR compatible. Works with both single pass and multipass rendering modes.<br>– Supports Standard, LW, HD and Universal Render Pipelines.<br>– Custom shader support (requires manual set-up).<br>– Animation Blending (up to 4 animations).<br>– Multiple skinned mesh renderers and submeshes support.<br>– LOD Groups support (all LOD meshes must use the same rig).<br>– Bone attachments.<br>– Root Motion support.<br>– Ability to use custom shadow distance per prototype and to choose the LOD to render shadows with.<br>– Automatic detection of added and removed instances without any additional code.<br>– Rigidbody and physics support.<br>– Custom animation event system.<br>– Easy to use interface.</p><p>Crowd Animations supports two different animator workflows:</p><p>Mecanim Animator:<br>You can use the Unity Mecanim Animator to handle the state machine for animations as usual, and GPUI will read the animator states from the Mecanim Animator. This will let you use your existing Animators and scripts with Crowd Animations, and make it possible to use indirect GPU Instancing out of the box with all the GPUI features such as GPU frustum and occlusion culling. This workflow increases GPU performance while rendering skinned meshes, but it won’t be an ideal solution for projects that are CPU bound since the Mecanim Animator will still create an overhang for each instance.<br>Crowd Animator:<br>You can use the Crowd Animator to handle your animation clips in the GPU through the GPUInstancer API and decide which animation to play at a given time. This workflow will require you to write your own scripts (or use visual scripting tools) to handle animation states manually – but this workflow will also let you get the most out of GPU Instancer since there won’t be any overhang created by the Mecanim Animator.</p><p>Current Limitations:<br>– Animation Layers and Masks are not supported.<br>– IK is not supported.<br>– Mobile platforms are not supported.<br>– Animation blending uses linear matrix interpolation, meaning blending animations that are very different might cause incorrect skinning results.</p><p>Supported Platforms:<br>– DirectX 11 or DirectX 12 and Shader Model 5.0 GPU (Windows)<br>– Metal (macOS)<br>– OpenGL Core 4.3 (Windows, Linux)<br>– Modern Consoles (PS4, Xbox One)</p>]]></content>

The only thing I wish you could do is that when you batch process all the images in a folder that you had the option to specify only a specific file type to process. It becomes a real hassle moving images in and out of folders before and after processing or deleting processed duplicate images that you didn’t want to process.

This is a must-have asset if you are working with Terrains on mobile devices.</p><p> It does what it says. It also automates everything for you so you don’t have to do anything in your scene after the conversion. I want to also include, a lot of people don’t really understand how unity terrain works so after the conversion they complain about blurry textures, etc.</p><p> Unity blends the textures creates lods, chunks, and does tricks to generate the terrain, converting it to mesh it eventually looks different or worse than the default since a mesh contains a material with a texture &amp; normal map and the mesh itself. If you don’t understand what”Terrain to mesh” actually does do not buy it, and expecting something entirely different. This plugin supports exporting the terrain to smaller chunks it also exports the texture to chunks in case you want to load each chunk separately or create occlusion. It’s great.</p>]]></content>
